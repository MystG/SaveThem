# SaveThem
This is a 2D game made on Unity for my Intro to Game Design class in Fall of 2015. Unfortunately, all of my game code was deleted before I could make a backup, so all I have now are the art assets, all made by me.

# The Concept
You play as an entity that calls itself "Wisp" and you try and help out this mother duck by finding all of her ducklings for her, who have run off into the forest. Wisp can turn itself into a scary looking entity known as the "Hate-o-Wisp" which it can use to trick some of the ducklings into running in a certain direction.

The annoying part is, some of the ducklings don't get along with each other which means that some will repel one another while others will attract one another. In other words, it's pretty hard to get them all to obediently go in a group. The only one who can get them to stay in a group is their mother, so once you get them to her, she can worry about keeping them together. She would go after them herself, but she's busy keeping her new egg warm. Maybe after finding them, they can tell you the story of why in the world they decided to run off like that.
